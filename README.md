# Database for Facebook ads

This is a repo for a dashboard for Facebook ads (and perhaps other online political content) built for reporters, by Quartz. It doesn't live on the web yet. There will eventually be a way for reporters to get access to it, but there isn't yet.

TODOs:
- add payer_id column on AdArchiveReportPage
- stop keeping page_name and disclaimer on AdArchiveReportPage (to save space).
